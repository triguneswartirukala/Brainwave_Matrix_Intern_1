🔍 Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning – Brief Overview
📌 Objective
The goal of the Fake News Detection model is to identify and classify news articles as either real or fake, using machine learning algorithms. This helps in curbing the spread of misinformation online.

🧠 What is Fake News?
Fake news refers to false or misleading information presented as news, often intended to deceive readers for political, financial, or social influence.

⚙️ Model Workflow
Data Collection

Collect datasets of real and fake news from open sources like Kaggle, news APIs, or web scrapers.

Preprocessing

Clean the text (remove punctuation, stopwords, etc.)

Tokenization & Lemmatization

Convert text into numerical format using TF-IDF or CountVectorizer

Model Training

Use algorithms like:

Logistic Regression

Naive Bayes

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Random Forest

Train the model on labeled data (real or fake).

Evaluation

Evaluate model performance using metrics like:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1 Score

Confusion Matrix

Prediction

The model classifies new/unseen news as real or fake based on learned patterns.

🧪 Example Dataset
Fake and real news dataset – Kaggle
